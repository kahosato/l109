\subsection{Airbnb Dataset}
Airbnb dataset was compiled by Murray Cox from publically available information on Airbnb website to build \emph{Inside Airbnb}~\citep{insideairbnb}, a tool to explore how Airbnb is used in various cities, including New York City.
The motivation of creating the tool was to demonstrate how Airbnb could be harmful to the residential housing.
The dataset has been used to expose various other social issues such as racial gentrification~\citep{gentrification}.
There are four tables and each describes:
\begin{itemize}
\item listings
\item when each listing is made available by the owner
\item user reviews for listings
\item name of the neighbourhoods
\end{itemize}
